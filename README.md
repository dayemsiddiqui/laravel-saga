The Laravel Saga package helps you manage complex workflows by breaking them down into a series of sequential steps. It orchestrates these steps as a 'saga', executing them in order and tracking the progress of each one in your database. This gives you a clear and persistent overview of your long-running processes, like an e-commerce order flow or a video processing pipeline.

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require dayemsiddiqui/laravel-saga
php artisan saga:install
```

And then you can run:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="saga-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
];
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="saga-views"
```

## Usage

### 1. Create Your Saga Steps

Each step in your saga should extend the `SagaStep` abstract class and implement the `run()` method:

```php
use dayemsiddiqui\Saga\SagaStep;

class FirstStep extends SagaStep
{
    protected function run(): void
    {
        // Your business logic here
        // You can access $this->context to share data between steps
        $this->context()->set('foo', 'bar');
    }
}

class SecondStep extends SagaStep
{
    protected function run(): void
    {
        // Access data from previous steps
        $foo = $this->context()->get('foo');
        // More business logic...
    }
}
```

### 2. Run a Saga

You can chain your steps and dispatch the saga like this:

```php
use dayemsiddiqui\Saga\Saga;

// Optionally, use the facade: use Saga;

$saga = Saga::named('My Example Saga')
    ->chain([
        FirstStep::class,
        SecondStep::class,
    ])
    ->dispatch();
```

-   Each step will be executed in order.
-   The saga and each stepâ€™s status will be tracked in the database.
-   Use the `context()` helper to share data between steps.

### Testing your Sagas

This package provides a fake implementation of the `Saga` facade that you can use in your tests to avoid actually dispatching the jobs.

To use it, call `Saga::fake()` at the beginning of your test.

```php
use dayemsiddiqui\Saga\Saga;
use Pest\Laravel\test;

test('example saga is dispatched', function () {
    Saga::fake();

    // Run the code that dispatches your saga
    // ...

    Saga::assertDispatched('My Example Saga');
});
```

#### `assertDispatched(string $name, ?array $steps = null)`

Asserts that a saga with the given name was dispatched. You can also optionally assert that it was dispatched with a specific chain of steps.

```php
Saga::assertDispatched('My Example Saga', [
    FirstStep::class,
    SecondStep::class,
]);
```

#### `assertNotDispatched(string $name)`

Asserts that a saga with the given name was not dispatched.

```php
Saga::assertNotDispatched('Some Other Saga');
```

#### `assertDispatchedCount(int $count)`

Asserts that a specific number of sagas were dispatched.

```php
Saga::assertDispatchedCount(1);
```
